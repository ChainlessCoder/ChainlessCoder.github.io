I'm fascinated with systems - any type of system. Biological systems, peer-to-peer systems, economic systems, social systems, you name it. I also love to invent new types of algorithms and data structures, it's an obsession of mine! Because of this, many of the topics in this blog will either be related to systems theory, or algorithms - and sometimes even biology ðŸ¤“
 
I'm the project lead at Xfai and co-founder of Open Cybernetics. My main role at Xfai is to invent and develop new cryptoeconomic primitives for the DeFi space. Whereas my main role at Open Cybernetics is to invent and develop new types of peer-to-peer protocols that aim to increase the autonomy and self-organization of people.
 
I have a bachelor's in Bioinformatics and am currently pursuing a master's in artificial intelligence at the JKU. My research interests include: Cybernetics, distributed systems, biological systems, economic systems, deep learning, decentralized machine learning, cosmo-localist material science.
