I'm fascinated with systems - any type of system. Biological systems, peer-to-peer systems, economic systems, social systems, you name it. I also love to come up with new types of algorithms and data structures.
 
My research interests include: Cybernetics, deep learning, decentralized machine learning, distributed systems, biological systems, economic systems, information theory, cosmo-localist material science.

I'm also a co-founder of [Open Cybernetics](opncbr.com).
