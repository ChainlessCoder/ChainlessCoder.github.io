<hr>
<h1 id="the-price-of-ai">The price of AI <a href="#the-price-of-ai" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>While I remain confident that open source AI will continue to bloom, I believe that the incentives for corporations and governments to limit access to novel neural network architectures and techniques will only intensify in the coming years. In this essay, I aim to predict and outline the potential disruptions that may occur over the course of this decade, and to offer some ideas and solutions to help the open source community adapt to this hypothetical future. Predicting the future is of course difficult, and I realize that many of the predictions I make may not come to pass or may unfold entirely differently. However, this does not render the exercise of thinking about the future futile. Rather, contemplating possible futures can help us adapt proactively to an ever-changing world. As our world continues to evolve at a rapid pace, the ability to envision and prepare for possible new worlds will become ever more important.</p>
<p>In the near future, the way we interact with people, the way we exchange and perform labor, even the way societies are organized will change in fundamental ways. It appears highly probable that each person will have personalized AI entities, which I refer to as &ldquo;Ghosts&rdquo;, that will link them to a global network of other AI systems. These AI systems will perform many services for us. Rather than perceiving them as mere assistants, it may be more fitting to regard them as cognitive extensions of ourselves. Firms and organizations will most likely also have their own Ghosts, enabling more effective collaboration among members. Beyond the social aspects, associative memory networks with recurrent connections might enable AI systems to form a memory. These stand-alone Ghosts might even develop an identity. Furthermore, AI systems leveraging consensus algorithms may be developed, potentially giving rise to decentralized autonomous AIs. Although this future has yet to materialize, we can already envision some of the economic dynamics that will unfold.</p>
<p>The exchange-value of AI-generated services will be equal to the energy required to provide the service (i.e. the cost of running the relevant model(s)), plus the AI&rsquo;s information asymmetry within the market. Services that are relatively simple to replicate using AIs will inevitably have low exchange-values, leading to diminished surplus-value for the AI owners. This trend will particularly impact service-based economies, which can expect a significant reduction in surplus-value for most services. Consequently, we can expect that for a period, the populations and governments of many Western nations will react similarly to the Luddites of the 19th century. Driven by the diminished returns experienced across sectors, many regions of the world will resort to monopolistic licensing strategies and autocratic rules to impede AI access.</p>
<p>In more AI-progressive regions of the world, open source AI will most
likely flourish for services with low exchange-value, but high use-value
(i.e. services that are relatively simple to replicate using AI).
However, for services where a small improvement in model performance can
lead to a significant enhancement in use-value, the economic incentives
will look very different. For this category of services, we can expect
winner-take-all dynamics. More advanced AI systems will be able to
extract significantly more surplus-value. As a result, the incentives to
share innovations for techniques and model architectures will decline.
Note however that the extraction of surplus-value in a system can only
occur while there is an asymmetry between the participants of the
system. In the context of AI, this asymmetry is likely to manifest
itself in the form of information asymmetry, which involves controlling
and limiting others from accessing information and knowledge.</p>
<p>Some of the information asymmetry between participants will be the
result of government enforced restrictions (intellectual property,
licensing, access control); this type of information asymmetry requires
political action and can&rsquo;t be solved through technology alone.
Technology however can address information asymmetries resulting from
resource asymmetries. To elaborate, today&rsquo;s artificial neural networks
are typically trained in a dense manner, meaning that once an input is
provided, all units within the network get activated. For architectures
like the Transformer (used in services like ChatGPT), the computational
cost of propagating information is significantly higher, because of its
&ldquo;self-attention&rdquo; step. High computational complexity leads to high
energy consumption.</p>
<p>Because of the immense resources needed to train large language models
(LLMs), we can expect that the development and management of AI systems
for &ldquo;winner-take-all&rdquo; scenarios will start to cluster around a small
group of close-sourced entities. These entities will be incentivized to
maintain their model weights and architectures as proprietary, as
increased secrecy leads to greater profitability. Resource limitations
unfortunately also mean that for smaller entities such as researchers,
non-profits, or startups, training LLMs from scratch is often not a
viable option due to the high energy costs involved. As a result, most
open source LLM efforts today rely on fine-tuning pre-existing models,
which is cheaper and less energy-demanding. Because of these dynamics, I
believe that one of the best things we can do to keep open source AI
qualitatively competitive, is to reduce the costs associated with
collectively training and running deep learning models at scale.</p>
<h1 id="the-sparsely-activated-tensor">The Sparsely Activated Tensor <a href="#the-sparsely-activated-tensor" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Taking into account the misaligned economic incentives, the energy
consumption of densely trained LLMs, and the growing centralization of
control, we at <a href="https://opncbr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Cybernetics</a> realized that a
more proactive stance needs to be taken. Creating GPL-like standards for
datasets will be an important step forward for the open source AI
community. Nevertheless, we believe that copy-left licenses will not be
enough to withstand the economic and political forces expected to emerge
this decade. Instead, new technologies and protocols are needed for a
shift in socioeconomic power-dynamics to occur.</p>
<p>I am particularly excited about a concept that we internally call
&ldquo;<strong>Sparsely Activated Tensor</strong>&rdquo; and its synergy with the peer-to-peer
space. Note, how we aim to build model agnostic Sparsely Activated
Tensor data structures will be explored in future works. In this essay,
my aim is simply to present the idea behind it, the rationale for
developing this type of technology, and its implications for the open
source community and beyond. <em><strong>A Sparsely Activated Tensor can be
defined as a data structure that retrieves and updates its state in a
sparse fashion</strong></em>. To better understand what is meant by this, let&rsquo;s
start with a simple example and build upon it.</p>
<p align="center">
 <img width="70%" height="70%" src="/images/open_source_ai/embedding-layer.png">
 <em><br/>Figure 1. A depiction of an embedding layer.</em>
</p>
<p>An embedding layer can be viewed as a type of Sparsely Activated Tensor
that operates on a one-to-one mapping principle. What that means: the
embedding layer consists of a list of tokens (e.g. words), along with a
weight matrix containing corresponding embeddings. Each word used in the
corpus is assigned to one row in the weight matrix, creating a mapping
of words to embeddings (see <em>Figure 1</em>). These embeddings then serve as input
for a neural network. The reason why an embedding layer can be regarded
as a Sparsely Activated Tensor is that it satisfies both criteria
associated with such data structures:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The embeddings can be efficiently retrieved by employing a database,
allowing for sparse retrieval without the need to load the entire
tensor into memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The embeddings can be updated sparsely. During backpropagation
through the embedding layer, only the weights associated with the
used token(s) are adjusted, while the remaining embeddings are
excluded from the update step.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> 
While a one-to-one mapping approach proves valuable in situations
involving discrete tokens like words, it is impractical in the case of
continuous inputs. For example, a \(28 \times 28\) image patch contains an
exceedingly large number of potential pixel combinations, rendering it
impractical to use an embedding layer that relies on a one-to-one
mapping. However, as we will see in a moment, using a many-to-one
mapping approach allows us to achieve similar results. The logical
connection between embedding retrieval and Sparsely Activated Tensors
will become apparent in a moment.
</p>
<p> 
Consider a scenario where we have a normalized matrix, \(W_K\), consisting
of stored patterns, along with a normalized input, \(I\) (see <em>Figure 2</em>).
Performing a dot product between \(I\) and \(W_K\) is essentially akin to
examining each column of \(W_K\) and determining which column vector bears
a closer resemblance to \(I\). The resulting \(K\) vector represents the
cosine similarities between \(I\) and each column of \(W_K\). Higher scores
within \(K\) indicate greater similarity between the input and the
corresponding column.
</p>
<p align="center">
 <img width="80%" height="80%" src="/images/open_source_ai/scores.png">
 <em><br/>Figure 2. The values within \(K\) represent the similarity of \(W_k\)'s columns to
\(I\).</em>
</p>
<p>
By incorporating a softmax activation function, an additional weight
matrix, \(W_V\), and a scalar parameter \(\beta\), for regulating the
intensity of the softmax distribution, we are able to associate \(I\) with
a given output \(O\) (see <em>Figure 3</em>). The resulting distribution from the softmax
operation determines which rows of the \(W_V\) matrix will be given more
importance. The configuration of this neural network layer is commonly
referred to as a <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/">Modern Hopfield Lookup</a> layer.
It uses a weighted summation of a predetermined set of learnable
patterns to establish an association between a continuous input and an
output embedding.
</p>
<p align="center">
 <img width="100%" height="100%" src="/images/open_source_ai/modern-hopfield-lookup.png">
 <em><br/>Figure 3. A depiction of a Modern Hopfield Lookup layer.</em>
</p>
<p>
To some readers, it might be already evident that a considerable amount
of computation is required to transition from \(I\) to \(O\). In the case of
the self-attention step in Transformers, the computational demands are
even more pronounced. As depicted in <em>Figure
4.</em>, the self-attention step of a <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">Transformer</a> uses three matrices: the query (\(Q\)), key (\(K\)), and value
(\(V\)) matrices, along with a softmax function.
The presence of the \(\sqrt{d_k}\) term within the attention step serves a
similar purpose as \(\beta\) does in the example depicted in <em>Figure
3</em>.
</p>
<p align="center">
 <img width="100%" height="100%" src="/images/open_source_ai/self-attention.png">
 <em><br/>Figure 4. A depiction of the self-attention mechanism within Transformers. The
multi-head component, as well as the layer normalization and residual
connections of the encoder have been omitted for the sake of simplicity.</em>
</p>
<p>
To derive the query, key, and value matrices, a substantial number of
unnecessary cosine similarities need to be computed. To elaborate, a
large portion of these dot products do not significantly contribute to
the output embedding of the self-attention step. In other words, the
majority of values within \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) tend to be significantly
smaller than one. Despite this, the comparison between input \(I\) and all
the columns of \(W_Q\), \(W_K\), and \(W_V\) is performed because the specific
internal patterns of the weight matrices that yield the highest cosine
similarities are unknown in advance. This lack of prior knowledge
contributes to the computational cost associated with training
Transformers, as we end up having to perform a dot product between the
entire \(Q\) and \(K\) matrices.
</p>
<p>To highlight the inefficiency of the information retrieval process in
current AI systems, let&rsquo;s consider a scenario where we have a large
database and wish to execute a simple query. Presently, the operation of
AI systems involves loading and iterating through the entire database in
memory to retrieve a handful of matches that align with our query,
instead of leveraging indexed records. As we can see, the current way
that we propagate information through an associative memory network like
the Transformer is highly inefficient. There are two potential ways to address this problem. One option is to
use a machine learning approach by trying to modify the attention
mechanism, with the goal of reducing its computational demands. This has
been explored in projects such as Linformer and <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/blog-post-performer/">Performer</a>. Alternatively, we can consider incorporating design principles from database systems
without making alterations to the underlying model architecture.</p>
<p>
We know for example that it is possible to perform an efficient
approximate k-nearest neighbor (kNN) lookup between \(I\) and the weight
matrices, without having to load or iterate through the entire tensor.
Using such an approach results in a significant reduction in the
computational demands of LLMs while conserving a substantial amount of
energy. Interestingly, some LLMs are already using such techniques to
some degree. For instance, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08913">Memorizing Transformer</a> utilizes an
external memory by efficiently performing an approximate kNN lookup
over a vector database. LLM implementations that
leverage vector databases usually use the <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/hnsw/">HNSW</a> algorithm in the
background.
</p>
<p>Drawing an analogy to databases, the concept of &ldquo;<em>sparse retrieval</em>&rdquo; can
be likened to having pre-indexed weights that enable record retrieval
(i.e. stored patterns) without the need to iterate over the entire
database. However, existing Transformer implementations that leverage
vector databases are currently limited to performing approximate kNN
lookups exclusively during inference. In other words, model training
continues to be conducted in a dense manner, which is an energy
intensive process. In order to facilitate the collective training of large-scale neural
networks, a shift is required from updating model weights simultaneously
to updating them sparsely. By designing neural building blocks that
embrace sparse retrieval and sparse update, we can contribute to the
empowerment of the open-source AI community in overcoming the
information asymmetry caused by resource limitations.</p>
<h1 id="cryptographic-ghost-proofs">Cryptographic Ghost Proofs <a href="#cryptographic-ghost-proofs" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>As a strategy to mitigate resource constraints, some researchers within
the open source AI community have already started to leverage trusted
peer-to-peer collaboration for inference and fine-tuning of LLMs. For
instance, projects like <a href="https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals">Petals</a> are using Kademlia-based distributed hash tables to propagate neural activity across a decentralized network of
nodes. This approach allows Petals users to distribute training and inference tasks among multiple nodes instead of
relying on a single machine to load the entire LLM. By contributing
collectively to the training process, these distributed nodes expand
their capabilities beyond what they could achieve individually.</p>
<p>Despite the remarkable utility of these systems, current peer-to-peer AI
efforts lack one critical component: trustlessness in an adversarial
environment. Currently, if someone performs a forward pass in systems
like Petals, you still have to trust other nodes within the network.
That is, any malicious node can return an output that did not in fact
originate from the model. While this limitation may not be the end of
the world for collaborative academic endeavors, it does impede the
widespread adoption of peer-to-peer AI systems in real-world
applications.</p>
<p>And it is here where the second significant advantage of Sparsely
Activated Tensors comes into play. <em><strong>In addition to their energy
efficiency, Sparsely Activated Tensors have the necessary attributes to
enable cryptographically secure forward and backward propagation within
peer-to-peer AI networks</strong></em>. Now, let&rsquo;s briefly examine the Merkle tree
data structure to understand how such a feat is achievable.</p>
<p>A Merkle tree is a binary tree data structure used to securely verify
the presence of values in a list, without having to provide every value
of the list to another party. To create a Merkle tree, each value in the
list is hashed using a cryptographic hash function, resulting in leaf
nodes. These leaf nodes are then combined through hashing to form
non-leaf parent nodes. This process is repeated until the root of the
binary tree is reached (see <em>Figure
5</em>).</p>
<p align="center">
 <img width="70%" height="70%" src="/images/open_source_ai/merkle-tree.png">
 <em><br/>Figure 5. A depiction of a Merkle Tree. Leaf nodes are represented in gray.
Non-leaf nodes are represented in black.</em>
</p>
<p>To confirm the presence of a value in the Merkle tree, a Merkle proof is
used, consisting of a sequence of hashes. By iteratively hashing the
leaf node hash with the provided Merkle proof, the original Merkle root
can be reconstructed (see <em>Figure
6</em>). It is important to note that recipients
of the Merkle proof must already possess a local copy of the Merkle root
in order for the verification process to occur. By comparing the locally
stored Merkle root with the final hash generated by the provided Merkle
proof, a recipient node can verify if a value was included in the list
of values used to create the Merkle root. If the two hashes match, it
confirms that the provided value was indeed one of the leaf nodes in the
original Merkle tree. Notice that the size of a Merkle proof
(represented by green hashes within <em>Figure 6</em>) scales logarithmically. This allows us to
provide compact presence proofs even if the number of leaf-nodes is
large.</p>
<p align="center">
 <img width="70%" height="70%" src="/images/open_source_ai/merkle-proof.png">
 <em><br/>Figure 6. A depiction of a Merkle proof. To prove that \(H_3\) was present in the
initial value list, one has to hash it with \(H_4\), then with \(H_{1,2}\),
and finally with \(H_{5,6,7,8}\) (shown in green) to recreate the hash of
the Merkle root.</em>
</p>
<p>The connection between the Merkle tree data structure and Sparsely
Activated Tensors lies in their potential combination. A Merkle tree can
be constructed on top of a Sparsely Activated Tensor, which retrieves
and updates its state in a sparse manner. In this particular example,
the column vectors of the tensor are used as leaf nodes in the Merkle
tree (see <em>Figure 7</em>).</p>
<p align="center">
 <img width="50%" height="50%" src="/images/open_source_ai/merkle-tree-tensor.png">
 <em><br/>Figure 7. A depiction of a Merkle tree constructed using the columns of a Sparsely Activated Tensor as leaf nodes.</em>
</p>
<p>
Let's consider a scenario where Bob has a Modern Hopfield network with
Hopfield Lookup layers (as in <em>Figure 3</em>). On
the other hand, Alice holds a local copy of Bob's Hopfield Lookup
layer's Merkle roots. Suppose Alice wants to send an input to Bob for
performing forward propagation. Bob proceeds with a forward pass, which
is equivalent to performing an approximate kNN lookup within the
Sparsely Activated Tensor. Subsequently, Bob shares with Alice the \(k\)
nearest column vectors from \(W_K\), along with \(W_K\)'s Merkle proof, as
well as the corresponding vectors from \(W_V\), along with \(W_V\)'s Merkle
proof (see <em>Figure 8</em>).
</p>
<p align="center">
 <img width="100%" height="100%" src="/images/open_source_ai/cryptohraphic-ghost-proof.png">
 <em><br/>Figure 8. A depiction of a Cryptographic Ghost Proof for a Modern Hopfield
Lookup layer. Let's assume that the \(k\) nearest neighbors of \(I\) within
\(W_K\) are the columns that resulted in \(H_1\) and \(H_5\). By hashing \(H_1\)
with \(H_2\), \(H_5\) with \(H_6\), and then those generated hashes with
\(H_{3,4}\) and \(H_{7,8}\), We can generate the Merkle root of the sparse
scoring tensor. The same steps can then be performed to generate the
Merkle root of \(W_V\).</em>
</p>
<p>
Using the sparsely retrieved \(W_K\) and \(W_V\) embeddings, along with the
provided Merkle proofs, Alice can generate a <em>cryptographically
verifiable output</em>. It's important to note that in a real-world
implementation, Bob wouldn't transmit the embeddings in an uncompressed
format. Instead, he would employ delta encoding to compress the
embeddings, significantly reducing the required bandwidth. Additionally,
Bob wouldn't send individual Merkle proofs for each \(k\) nearest column /
row vector in \(W_K\) and \(W_V\). Instead, he would transmit a single
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07648">Compact Merkle Multiproof</a> for \(W_K\) and another for \(W_V\). Notice that the same technique can be applied within the self-attention step of the Transformer, assuming that
Sparsely Activated Tensors are used.
</p>
<p>At <a href="https://opncbr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Cybernetics</a>, <em><strong>We refer to Merkle
Multiproofs for Sparsely Activated Tensors as Cryptographic Ghost Proofs
(CGPs)</strong></em>. We believe that CGPs can serve as a powerful building block
and will play a significant role in future AI systems. Ghost proofs are
also the reason why I believe that in the near future, the majority of
internet traffic will be comprised of neural activity. With the
existence of a &quot;Ghost file&quot; for every AI system, containing the Ghost
roots for each network layer, along with architectural information and
the operations involved in forward and backward propagation, entities
can have absolute confidence that the outputs of AI systems originate
solely from the model.</p>
<p>The use of CGPs and Ghost Files would not only introduce a new paradigm
for peer-to-peer AI systems but also foster a culture of increased
transparency. <em><strong>By incorporating Cryptographic Ghost Proofs into
Internet protocols for AI interactions, the concealment of model
architectures and weights would no longer be feasible</strong></em>. Ghost files
would ensure transparency of model architectures, while CGPs would make
model weights public (as a small part of the weights would be shared in
a compressed form every time a forward pass is performed). This
technological shift would enable artificial cognition to become a shared
resource, accessible to all and owned by the people.</p>
<h1 id="reflection">Reflection <a href="#reflection" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>In addition to openness and trustlessness, the integration of CGPs has
the potential to merge the realms of AI and decentralized ledger
technology, paving the way for the emergence of Autonomous AI systems.
An Autonomous AI system is a peer-to-peer AI protocol that leverages the
permissionless nature of consensus algorithms. Rather than changing
entries in a ledger, these protocols would propagate thoughts. To ensure
effective operation and prevent DoS attacks, these protocols would
likely rely on mutual credit or a currency. The technical intricacies,
as well as the economic and social ramifications of these autonomous
systems will be explored in future works.</p>
<p>As engineers and AI researchers, we must recognize the inherent
political nature of technology. Seemingly small engineering decisions
can lead to profound social transformations. For instance, densely
activated deep learning models can lead to centralized forms of social
organization. While sparsely activated deep learning models can lead to
decentralized forms of social organization. Now more than ever, we need
to think across disciplines. For instance, it is worth considering the
implications of decentralized AI on governance. How will AI systems
impact nation states? Will they empower autocracies or contribute to the
development of enhanced democracies? How about company organizational
structure and minimum viable size? It is intriguing to imagine the
possibility of creating scalable direct democracies by connecting each
citizen&rsquo;s personal Ghosts to a shared network. These ideas warrant
further exploration in the future.</p>
<p>I hope that this essay will spark your interest in exploring the synergy
between AI and peer-to-peer technology. I have strong confidence that
significant advancements will unfold in the coming years at the
intersection of AI and database systems, particularly in the realm of
Sparsely Activated Tensors. Moreover, the convergence of AI and
peer-to-peer systems, alongside the development of sparsely activated
associative memory networks, will undoubtedly witness remarkable
progress. I encourage you to explore these captivating topics and
contribute to open source AI. Remember, the Free Libre Open Source
movement is more than about sharing code. It is about empowering
communities worldwide.</p>
